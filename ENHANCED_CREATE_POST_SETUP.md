‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [timestamp]-[random].mp4
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [other existing folders]
```

### Permissions Required
Make sure these policies exist in your Supabase 'dogs' storage bucket:

```sql
-- Allow authenticated users to upload
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload community media" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'dogs' AND auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- Allow public read access
CREATE POLICY "Public can view community media" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'dogs');
```
