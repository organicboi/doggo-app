modalContainer: {
  flex: 1,
  backgroundColor: 'black',
  justifyContent: 'center',
}

// Video container with aspect ratio preservation
videoContainer: {
  flex: 1,
  backgroundColor: 'black',
  position: 'relative',
}

// Enhanced control overlay system
controlsOverlay: {
  position: 'absolute',
  top: 0,

  right: 0,
  bottom: 0,
  backgroundColor: 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3)',
  justifyContent: 'space-between',
  padding: 20,
}

// Professional replay button
replayButton: {
  width: 100,
  height: 100,
  borderRadius: 50,
  backgroundColor: 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8)',
  alignItems: 'center',
  justifyContent: 'center',
  shadowColor: '#000',
  shadowOffset: { width: 0, height: 4 },
  shadowOpacity: 0.3,
  shadowRadius: 8,
  elevation: 8,
  borderWidth: 3,
  borderColor: '#FF6B6B',
}
```

## Technical Implementation

### Modern Video Architecture

- Uses `expo-video` package for cutting-edge video playback
- Leverages `react-native-gesture-handler` for smooth interactions
- Integrates `expo-haptics` for premium tactile feedback
- Implements comprehensive state management for all video phases

### Key Technical Features

1. **Reliable Control System**:
   ```typescript
   const handleVideoPress = () => {
     // Always show controls when video frame is clicked
     setShowControls(true);
     animateControlsVisibility(true);
     
     // Smart auto-hide logic based on video state
     if (!hasEnded) {
       hideControlsAfterDelay();
     }
   };
   ```

2. **End Detection Algorithm**:
   ```typescript
   // Robust end detection within 0.5 seconds of duration
   const isNearEnd = newDuration > 0 && (newDuration - newCurrentTime) <= 0.5;
   const playerHasEnded = !player.playing && newCurrentTime > 0 && isNearEnd;
   ```

3. **Comprehensive Replay System**:
   ```typescript
   const handleReplay = () => {
     player.currentTime = 0;  // Reset to beginning
     setHasEnded(false);      // Reset end state
     player.play();           // Start playback
     // Haptic feedback and animations
   };
   ```

### State Management

The video system tracks multiple states for optimal user experience:

- **Player states**: `isPlaying`, `currentTime`, `duration`, `isPlayerReady`
- **Control states**: `showControls`, `hasEnded`, `showReplayButton`
- **Interaction states**: `showVolumeSlider`, `showSpeedOptions`
- **Animation states**: `controlsAnimation`, `replayButtonAnimation`

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Efficient Memory Usage**:
   - Player instances created fresh for each video (Netflix approach)
   - Comprehensive cleanup on modal close
   - Smart thumbnail generation with caching

2. **Smooth Animations**:
   - Hardware-accelerated animations using `useNativeDriver: true`
   - Spring animations for natural feel
   - Optimized re-renders with proper state management

3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**:
   - Consistent experience on iOS and Android
   - Platform-specific optimizations where needed
   - Fallback handling for different video formats
