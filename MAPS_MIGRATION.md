# Maps Migration: Google Maps to React Native Maps

## Overview
The maps functionality has been migrated from Google Maps to React Native Maps, which provides a more open-source solution.

## What Changed

### 1. Map Provider
- **Before**: Used `PROVIDER_GOOGLE` with Google Maps API
- **After**: Uses default React Native Maps provider (Apple Maps on iOS, Google Maps on Android)

### 2. Configuration Updates
- Removed Google Maps API key requirements from `app.config.js`
- Removed platform-specific Google Maps configurations
- Simplified app configuration

### 3. Components Updated
The following components were updated to remove Google Maps dependencies:
- `ResponsiveMapScreen.tsx` (main maps tab component)
- `MapTest.tsx`
- `UltraMapScreen.tsx`
- `RedesignedMapScreen.tsx`
- `PremiumMapScreen.tsx`
- `MaterialUltraMapScreen.tsx`
- `ImprovedMaterialMapScreen.tsx`
- `FixedMaterialMapScreen.tsx`
- `EnhancedMaterialMapScreen.tsx`

## Benefits

1. **No API Key Required**: React Native Maps uses native map providers
2. **Better Privacy**: No data sent to Google Maps servers
3. **Open Source**: More transparent and community-driven
4. **Platform Native**: Uses Apple Maps on iOS and Google Maps on Android
5. **Simplified Setup**: No need for API keys or billing setup

## Features Preserved

All existing map features continue to work:
- ✅ User location tracking
- ✅ Dog markers with custom SVG icons
- ✅ Emergency markers
- ✅ Map interactions (long press, marker press)
- ✅ Search and filtering
- ✅ Bottom sheets and modals
- ✅ Real-time data updates

## Platform Behavior

- **iOS**: Uses Apple Maps (native iOS maps)
- **Android**: Uses Google Maps (native Android maps)
- **Web**: Falls back to web-compatible map solution

## No Action Required

The migration is complete and no additional setup is required. The app will automatically use the appropriate native map provider for each platform.
